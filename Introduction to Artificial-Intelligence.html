<h3>Introduction</h3>
The name “artificial intelligence” covers a lot of disparate problem areas,
 united mainly by the fact that they involve complex inputs and outputs that are difficult to compute.
 One of the most interesting such areas is sensor-controlled behavior,<br />
in which a machine acts in the real world using information gathered from sensors such as sonars and cameras. This is a major focus of A.I. research at Yale.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
 Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing.<br />and another deffinetion
the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.<br />
 The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans.
